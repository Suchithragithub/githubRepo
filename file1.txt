Git is a free and open-source version control 
system, originally created by Linus Torvalds 
in 2005. Unlike older centralized version 
control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is 
distributed: every developer has the full 
history of their code repository locally.

Git handles content in snapshots, one for 
each commit, and knows how to apply or roll 
back the change sets between two snapshots.
